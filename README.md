# TryHackMe Labs and Activities 💻⚔️

## Overview
Step into the cybersecurity ring! 🏟️ This repository captures my training on the TryHackMe platform, where I faced off against real-world challenges in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessments. Each lab brought new opportunities to strengthen my skills and sharpen my instincts. 💪

## Key Highlights
- **SIEM Smackdown** 🔍: Investigated logs and hunted threats using Splunk, revealing patterns and anomalies like a true digital detective.
- **Network Grapple** 🌐: Analyzed packets with Wireshark, breaking down network traffic and spotting the moves of potential attackers.
- **Web Vulnerability Showdown** 🛡️: Explored exploits like SQL Injection and XSS while learning the counters to block them in their tracks.
- **Scenario-Based Training** 🎯: Engaged in phishing detection, endpoint monitoring, and incident response scenarios designed to simulate the real thing.

## File Included
- **Ian K. Marusak - TryHackMe Journal-1.pdf** 📄: A detailed log of my victories and lessons learned through the TryHackMe platform.
