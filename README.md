# TryHackMe Labs and Activities 💻⚔️

## Overview
Step into the cybersecurity ring! 🏟️ This repository captures my training on the TryHackMe platform, where I faced off against real-world challenges in threat detection, incident response, and vulnerability assessments. Each lab brought new opportunities to strengthen my skills and sharpen my instincts. 💪
My journey through TryHackMe, documenting key takeaways, hands-on exercises, and challenges completed in cybersecurity labs. From Splunk investigations to network traffic analysis, this journal captures the lessons learned along the way.
